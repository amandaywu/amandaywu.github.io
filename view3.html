					<p class="line"> 1. Joshua Tree National Park is named for the Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia) native to the park.<br/>
						Joshua trees themselves are supposedly so named because, upon seeing them, <br/>
						Mormon settlers were reminded of a biblical story of Joshua reaching his hands to the sky.  </p>
					<p class="line"> 2. Early explorer John Fremont described Joshua trees as <br/>“the most repulsive tree in the vegetable Kingdom”.  </p>
					<p class="line"> 3. The park lies at an ecological crossroads, where the high <br/>
						Mojave Desert meets the low Colorado Desert.  </p>
					<p class="line"> 4. The park’s oldest rocks, Pinto gneiss among them, are 1.7 billion years old.    </p>
					<p class="line"> 5. Joshua Tree National Park is a popular location for astronomy <br/>
						and stargazing. It is well known for its dark skies, which are largely free from<br/>
						southern California’s extreme light pollution.  </p>
					<p class="line"> 6. In 1972, the album cover photos for Eagles were shot in Joshua Tree National Park. </p>
					<p class="line"> 7. When rocker Gram Parsons died in 1973 near the park, friends <br/>
						took matters into their own hands and created his body near Cap Rock; he was a <br/>
						frequent visitor to Joshua Tree. More than 40 years later, Parsons’ fans still <br/>
						visit Cap Rock (accessible by a 0.4-mile loop trail) to pay their respects.  </p>
					<p class="line"> 8. In 1987, Irish rock band U2 released their fifth studio album, <br/>
						The Joshua Tree, named after a tree with which the band were photographed near <br/>
						Darwin, California. It is a common misconception that the site of this tree is <br/>
						within Joshua Tree National Park, when in fact it is over 320 kilometers (200 miles) away.  </p>
					<p class="line"> 9. The first group known to inhabit the area was the Pinto Culture,<br/>
						 followed by American Indians including the Serrano, the Chemehuevi, and the Cahuilla.  </p>
